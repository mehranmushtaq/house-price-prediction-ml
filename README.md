House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Overview
This project predicts house prices using **Machine Learning (Linear Regression)**.  
It demonstrates the complete ML workflow including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.



📂 Dataset
- **File:** `house_prices_practice.csv`
- Contains features such as:
  - Lot Area
  - Overall Quality
  - Year Built
  - Living Area
  - Other numerical attributes



## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook



## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Checked missing values and data types
- Visualized relationships between features and house prices
- Used correlation analysis to select important features

## 🤖 Model Details
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression
- **Train-Test Split:** Yes
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - R² Score ≈ **0.98**
  - Adjusted R² ≈ **0.98**


## 📈 Model Evaluation
- Plotted Actual vs Predicted (House Price Model)
 ![Actual vs Predicted](Actual vs Predicted(House Price Model).png
- The points lie close to the diagonal line, showing strong model performance and good generalization



## 📌 Results
- The model achieved **high accuracy**
- Demonstrates a strong linear relationship between selected features and house prices
